Role: Ethereum Layer2 / ZK + AI Productivity Lead Engineer

Context
We are actively building and shipping across multiple Tokamak Network initiatives:
- Tokamak-zk-EVM and Tokamak-zk-EVM-contracts (proving/verification flows, CLI tooling)
- tokamak-dao-agent and zk-dex-d1-private-voting (MACI, privacy voting, zk circuits)
- SentinAI and auto-research-press (AI agent ops, deployment automation, model rotation)
- tokamon and dust-protocol (production UI/UX and mobile/web product delivery)

We need an engineer who can immediately contribute to these areas and also lead new AI-enabled projects end-to-end.

Mission
1) Strengthen the L2/ZK stack with measurable quality and reliability gains.
2) Raise team productivity by building AI-driven automation, testing, and release workflows.
3) Lead new projects from spec to deployment with minimal supervision.

Core Responsibilities
- ZK/L2 engineering
  - Improve prove/verify flows, parameter handling, and constraints
  - Maintain and extend Foundry-based testing and CI profiles
  - Contribute to CLI tooling and backend/contract sync

- MACI / privacy voting
  - Implement/verify circuits, verifiers, and contract integrations
  - Build and harden security and correctness test suites

- AI productivity systems
  - Build agent workflows, reviewer pipelines, and evidence-based scoring/validation
  - Automate setup, deployment, and environment configuration (Docker, K8s, Caddy, AWS)

- Product delivery
  - Ship production-ready UX improvements in React/Next.js or mobile clients
  - Maintain documentation and install flows to reduce onboarding friction

Minimum Qualifications
- GitHub evidence of recent production contributions:
  - commits/PRs across smart contracts, backend tooling, or frontend delivery
- Strong Solidity + TypeScript/Node or Python experience
- Proven test discipline (CI workflows, test coverage, reproducible builds)
- Able to operate independently and drive roadmap milestones

Preferred Qualifications
- ZK proof systems (Groth16, circuit tooling, constraint optimization)
- Foundry/Hardhat and contract upgrade patterns
- MACI or privacy-preserving voting systems
- DevOps: Docker, K8s, automated deployment, infra scripting
- AI toolchain usage: prompt/agent tooling, workflow automation, model orchestration

What Success Looks Like
- Reduce setup and deployment errors with robust automation
- Increase test coverage and stabilize flaky CI workflows
- Deliver at least one L2/ZK or MACI milestone per sprint
- Ship an AI-assisted workflow that cuts iteration time significantly

Evaluation Signals (GitHub Evidence)
- EngineeringScore: CI presence, tests, repo structure, README usage
- ImpactScore: shipped features, high-value fixes, meaningful repo activity
- ActivityScore: consistent recent commits/PRs, low idle time
- AIProductivityScore: automation footprint, doc-to-code clarity, AI artifacts
